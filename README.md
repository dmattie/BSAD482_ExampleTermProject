# Global Water Security Analysis Project
*A Decision Intelligence Approach to Understanding SDG 6*

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes global water security challenges through the lens of UN Sustainable Development Goal 6. Using comprehensive datasets from international organizations, we aim to identify patterns, predict trends, and recommend interventions to improve water access and management globally. Our analysis combines traditional statistical methods with advanced machine learning techniques to uncover insights about water security determinants and their relationships with other development indicators.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Water Access Index (WAI)**
   - Percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water services
   - Target: Annual improvement of 3 percentage points in underserved regions
   - Baseline: Current global average of 74%

2. **Water Stress Level (WSL)**
   - Freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources
   - Target: Maintain below 70% threshold in all regions
   - Measured quarterly to account for seasonal variations

3. **Infrastructure Efficiency Ratio (IER)**
   - Ratio of water loss through infrastructure to total water distribution
   - Target: Reduce to below 15% in urban areas
   - Monthly monitoring where smart infrastructure exists

4. **Water Quality Compliance Rate (WQCR)**
   - Percentage of water sources meeting WHO safety standards
   - Target: 95% compliance rate
   - Weekly monitoring at treatment facilities

5. **Economic Water Security Score (EWSS)**
   - Composite score incorporating water availability, affordability, and economic impact
   - Target: Minimum score of 7/10 for all regions
   - Annual assessment with quarterly progress reviews
