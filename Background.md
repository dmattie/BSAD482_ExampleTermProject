# Understanding Global Water Security: Access, Quality, and Sustainability
*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 6*

## Problem Context
Water security represents one of humanity's most pressing challenges, sitting at the intersection of public health, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Despite progress in recent decades, 2.2 billion people still lack access to safely managed drinking water, while 4.2 billion lack safely managed sanitation services [[1]](#1). This analysis focuses on UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030 [[1]](#1).

The challenge of water security is particularly complex due to its interconnected nature with other global issues. Climate change is altering precipitation patterns and increasing water stress in many regions [[3]](#3). Rapid urbanization strains existing water infrastructure [[4]](#4), while agricultural intensification competes for water resources [[5]](#5)[[6]](#6). Understanding these dynamics requires a multifaceted analysis incorporating environmental, social, and economic factors. Water security jeopardizes growth prospects in the regions worst affected and in some of the poorest countries [[7]](#7), highlighting how our global community must unite across borders, sectors, and socioeconomic divisions to ensure equitable access to this fundamental resource - for without collective action, we risk perpetuating a cycle where water scarcity deepens poverty, and poverty limits the very infrastructure investments needed to achieve water security.

## Significance of the Study
This analysis is timely and crucial for several reasons:

1. Water scarcity affects over 40% of the global population [[7]](#7), a figure projected to rise with climate change. Understanding regional variations and trends in water access can inform targeted interventions.

2. Economic impacts of poor water management are severe, with the World Bank estimating that some regions could see their GDP decline by up to 6% by 2050 due to water-related losses [[7]](#7).

3. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of water access for public health, as basic hand hygiene remains impossible for billions globally.

4. Recent technological advances in water management, treatment, and monitoring create new opportunities for data-driven solutions.

## Research Objectives
This study aims to:
1. Analyze global patterns in water access and quality across different socioeconomic contexts
2. Identify key determinants of successful water management programs
3. Assess the relationship between water security and other development indicators
4. Project future water stress scenarios under different climate and population models
